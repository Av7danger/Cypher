Cybersecurity Toolkit

Cybersecurity Toolkit is a desktop application built using Flutter, designed to provide essential cybersecurity utilities in one place. The app is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux and includes tools such as a Port Scanner, Ping Utility, Traceroute, Hash Generator, and more.
Features
1. Port Scanner

    Scan a range of ports on a target IP to identify open or closed ports.
    Displays results in real time with port status and error handling.

2. Ping Utility

    Ping a domain or IP address to measure network response time and connectivity.
    View real-time results including packet loss, latency, and response time.

3. Traceroute

    Trace the network path between your machine and a target IP or domain.
    Displays each network hop, including response times for each node along the path.

4. DNS Lookup

    Perform DNS lookups to resolve domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.

5. Whois Lookup

    Retrieve WHOIS information for a given domain or IP address.
    Displays domain ownership, registration dates, and other public information.

6. MAC Address Lookup

    Identify the manufacturer/vendor of a network device based on its MAC address.

7. Hash Generators

    Generate cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for given text.
    Useful for verifying file integrity and creating checksums.

8. Password Strength Checker

    Check the strength of a given password based on length and complexity.

9. Encryption/Decryption Utility

    Perform AES or RSA encryption and decryption for simple text messages.

10. Network Traffic Monitor (Packet Sniffer)

    Capture and analyze network packets using libraries like pcap (Linux/macOS) or winpcap (Windows).
    Display packet details such as source/destination IP, protocol, packet size, etc.
    Could include filters for specific protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP).

11. Netstat Utility

    Replicate the functionality of the netstat command.
    Show active network connections, routing tables, listening ports, and network interfaces.

12. Bandwidth Usage Monitor

    Monitor real-time network bandwidth usage.
    Track data sent/received per interface (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and display as graphs or charts.

13. ARP Scanner

    Perform an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) scan to detect all devices on the local network.
    List MAC and IP addresses for active hosts, which can help detect unauthorized devices.

14. Nmap Wrapper

    Integrate Nmap (if installed on the system) via command-line to perform more detailed scans, such as OS detection, version detection, or stealth scanning.
    Password Manager

    Securely store and manage passwords using encryption.
    Generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined rules (length, special characters, etc.).

15. Digital Signature Verifier

    Verify digital signatures for files and documents using public-key cryptography.
    Could integrate PGP/GPG key management for signing and verifying messages.

16. SSL/TLS Certificate Checker

    Analyze SSL/TLS certificates for websites or servers to check expiration, validity, and the strength of encryption.
    Report on possible vulnerabilities like weak ciphers or improper configurations.

17. JWT Decoder

    Decode and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for authentication.
    Display header, payload, and signature information with clear formatting.

18. Keylogger Detection

    Scan the system for common keylogger signatures or suspicious activities.
    Use heuristics to detect processes that log keyboard inputs.
